# Authentication

The Livepeer.com API uses API keys to authenticate most requests, including all
requests associated with creating and retrieving a stream or session object.

The Livepeer.com API uses Bearer authentication. You or the client must send an
API key in the Authorization header when making requests to protected
information:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. API requests without proper
authentication will fail.
