# The `session` object

The `session` object is a single live streaming session. It is an especially
important Livepeer.com API object if need to reference recorded live stream
sessions.

All `session` objects have a `stream` object parent. The session's `parentId` is
the same string as its parent stream's `id`.

`session` objects are read-only. Many `session` parameter values are inherited
directly from its `stream` parent, for example `profiles`, `record`, `streamKey`
and `playbackId` (all sessions with the same `parentId` use the same `streamKey`
and have the same .m3u8 playback URL).

Other `session` parameter values are unique to it, for example `id`, ingested
`sourceSegments`, duration data, and `recordingUrl` among others.

| `profiles`                   | array   | Transcoding rendition settings, inherited from the parent `stream` `profiles`.

It is either `ready` when the recorded live stream is available for playback or `waiting` while the livestream is still active or just recently completed.                                                                                          |
| `recordingURL`               | string  | Appears only if `record` is `true` and when `recordingStatus` changes to `ready`. Its value is the .m3u8 URL to stream the recorded session.                                                                                                                                            |

| `streamKey`                  | string  | Unique secret key used to form the RTMP ingest URL. All sessions with the same `parentId` use the same `streamKey`.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `transcodedSegments`         | number  | Number of transcoded rendition segments processed. Should be (`sourceSegments` \* number of `profiles`).                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `transcodedSegmentsDuration` | number  | Duration in seconds of transcoded renditions processed. Should be (`sourceSegmentsDuration` \* number of `profiles`).                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `userID`                     | string  | Unique identifier for the Livepeer.com user account that created the parent `stream` object.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
