# API Requests

The Livepeer.com API is a video live streaming API. With the Livepeer.com API,
you or the client can configure details for live broadcasting software, generate
a playback URL for stream viewers, get usage data about your stream sessions and
more. Explore the [Livepeer.com API reference](/docs/api-reference) for more
information.

The Livepeer.com API base url is `https://livepeer.com/api/`. As you make
requests, the Livepeer.com API returns JSON responses.

## Authentication

The Livepeer.com API uses API keys to authenticate most requests, including all
requests associated with creating and retrieving a stream or session object.

The Livepeer.com API uses Bearer authentication. You or the client must send an
API key in the Authorization header when making requests to protected
information:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. API requests without proper
authentication will fail.

## Errors

The Livepeer.com API uses conventional HTTP status codes.

`2XX` = success

`4XX` = client error, problem with information provided

`5XX` = internal server error, problem with Livepeer servers
