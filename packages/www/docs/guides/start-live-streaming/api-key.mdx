# Get an API key

You need an API key to make requests of the Livepeer.com API. You do not need to
create an API key if you are creating and configuring live streams using the
Livepeer.com Dashboard only.

Login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and navigate to the Developers tab,
[livepeer.com/dashboard/developers/api-keys](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/developers/api-keys).
On this page, you can create, delete and find out the most recent usage of your
API keys.

When you create a new API key, copy and secure the API key. This key is a
secret, and for your security, Livepeer.com will not show it to you again.

If you forget your API key, delete the forgotten key, and create a new API key.
