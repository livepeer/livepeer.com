# Configure broadcast software

You or your application users need to be able to push an RTMP stream. To
broadcast a live stream, you’ll need a stream key.

Here are several ways to find your stream key:

- Login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, navigate to the streams list page,
  [livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams), and
  click on a stream name. Reveal and copy your secret stream key.
- When you create a `stream` object with a `POST` request to
  `https://livepeer.com/api/stream`, note the value of the `streamKey` in the
  response.
- Make a `GET` request to `https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}`, and note the
  value of the `streamKey` in the response

When configuring broadcast software to push streams, use the secret `streamKey`
and the Livepeer.com RTMP ingest URL, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live`.

Depending on the software used to push your RTMP stream, you’ll be prompted for
the following:

- Stream Key: In some cases, this is called a "Stream Name." Input your
  Livepeer.com `streamKey` not the name of your stream.
- Server URL: Input the RTMP ingest URL, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live`.
- Location or URL: Input the ingest url with the `streamKey` appended. For
  example, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{streamKey}`.

## Optimization: Set keyframe intervals

Livepeer works best with consistent, short keyframe intervals, ideally 2
seconds.

You should set or encourage your users to set this in their broadcasting
software. In [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), you can set this by going to
"Settings" --> "Output", change the "Output Mode" from "Simple" to "Advanced"
and set the "Keyframe interval" to 2.
