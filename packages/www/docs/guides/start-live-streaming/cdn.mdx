# Stream delivery via CDN

Playback for all Pro plan streams is delivered via a content delivery network
(CDN). The transcoded video stream automatically switches between the transcoded
renditions based on the viewersâ€™ available bandwidth, device performance, and
network conditions.

Non-CDN delivery for free tier users is limited to 10 viewers per account.
