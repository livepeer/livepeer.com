# Create a stream

## The `stream` object

Live streaming with Livepeer.com is easy. The first step is understanding the
`stream` object. It is the core building block of the Livepeer.com platform.

A Livepeer.com `stream` is a unique object with configuration data and metadata
about all live stream sessions associated with it. Historically, a `stream`
object with a `parentId` represents a single live stream session. This type of
“child-session” stream object will be deprecated in an upcoming version of the
API in favor of the `session` object.

There are two ways to create a stream object:

### No code stream creation with the Livepeer.com Dashboard

Login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and navigate to the Streams page,
[livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams). On
this page you can create a new stream and delete streams. When you name your
stream, pick a unique name and include URL compatible characters only.

On the Stream page
([livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams)), you
can also click on a stream to find out configuration and usage information.

### Create a stream object with a POST request to the API

Send a `POST` request to `https://livepeer.com/api/stream`. This creates a new
Livepeer.com `stream` object.

Use a Livepeer.com API key as a part of the authorization header, and use a JSON
body to specify the configuration for the stream. The only parameter you are
required to set is the `name` of your stream, but we also highly recommend that
you define the `profiles` parameter with 720p, 480p and 360p renditions.

If you do not define transcoding rendition `profiles` when creating the
`stream`, no transcoding will happen. Your playback video will have the
attributes of the source stream only, will not take advantage of adaptive
bitrate streaming and will likely buffer.

Here is an example request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "480p",
      "bitrate": 1000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 854,
      "height": 480
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
}' \
https://livepeer.com/api/stream
```

This is an example response to the request above. `streamKey`, `playbackId`, and
`id` are unique to the `stream` object. You will need the `streamKey` to
broadcast live video and the `playbackId` to configure the playback URL to watch
the live stream.

```json
{
    "name":"test_stream",
    "profiles":[
        {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},
        {"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480},
        {"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360},
      ],
    "id":"ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
    "createdAt":1596081229373,
    "streamKey":"abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
    "playbackId":"efghb2mxupongp5k",
    {other asset object keys}
}
```
