# Playback a live stream

This is how a Livepeer.com playback URL is formatted:
`https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

All sessions for a stream have the same playback URL.

The easiest way to the stream playback URL is to login to the Livepeer.com
Dashboard, navigate to the Streams page,
[livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams), and
click on a stream name. The playback URL is listed on the page.

You can also make a `GET` request to `https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}`, and
note the value of `playbackId` in the response. The playback URL is
`https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

## Video player

Users can view the live stream with any HLS video player (for example
[video.js](https://videojs.com/) or [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/)).

## Stream delivery via CDN

Playback for all Pro plan streams is delivered via a content delivery network
(CDN). The transcoded video stream automatically switches between the transcoded
renditions based on the viewers’ available bandwidth, device performance, and
network conditions.

Non-CDN delivery for free tier users is limited to 10 viewers per account.

## What if playback isn’t working?

Look at the `lastSeen` and `isActive` (Status row on the Livepeer.com Dashboard)
values. If ingest was properly configured for playback, `lastSeen` will show the
current date and time and `isActive` will be `true` (Status row on the
Livepeer.com Dashboard will be Active).

If this isn't the case, confirm the `streamKey` and RTMP ingest URL,
`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live`, are configured correctly in your broadcast
software.

Lastly, check that your playback URL is correct.
