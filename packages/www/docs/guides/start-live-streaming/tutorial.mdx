# Start live streaming with Livepeer.com

There are multiple ways to livestream with Livepeer.com. The only prerequisite
for using Livepeer.com is to be able to create an RTMP stream.

You can integrate your streaming application directly with the Livepeer.com API.
Or you can use the Livepeer.com Dashboard to live stream without writing any
code.

In this quick tutorial, you will learn how to create a unique stream object,
broadcast live video content and playback your live stream with Livepeer.com.

## Step 1: Create a stream

Login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and navigate to the Streams page,
[livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams),
located in the left-hand menu. Click on the "+ Create stream" button on the top
right corner. When you name your stream, pick a unique name and include URL
compatible characters only.

Then you’ll be redirected to a detailed page with information about your new
stream. Keep this page open. You will need this information for configuring your
broadcasting software in step 2 and playing back your live stream in step 3.

## Step 2 (option 1): Go live using OBS

OBS is free and open source software for live streaming.
[Download and install OBS.](https://obsproject.com/download)

Before streaming, we need to configure OBS. Click on Settings in the lower right
corner.

First, let’s set the keyframe interval.

1. In the Settings sidebar menu, select Output.
2. At the top, select Advanced from the Output Mode dropdown.
3. In the Keyframe Interval row, input 2 in the text field.

Next, let’s configure OBS to point to Livepeer.com’s RTMP ingest data centers.

1. In the Setting sidebar menu, select Stream.
2. At the top, select Custom from the Service dropdown menu.
3. Input `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live` in the Server text field.
4. Navigate to the stream detail page, click the “Reveal stream key” button, and
   copy the stream key.
5. Navigate back to OBS, and paste your stream key into the Stream Key text
   field.
6. Confirm the Use Authentication checkbox is unchecked.
7. Click OK in the lower right corner to save your updated server and keyframe
   interval settings.

When you are ready to start your live stream, click Start Streaming in the lower
right corner of OBS.

## Step 2 (option 2): Go live using in-browser broadcaster

If downloading OBS feels cumbersome, there are a few in-browser broadcaster
options. Livepeer users have had success with
[Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/) or
[Restream Studio](https://restream.io/).

To use Streamyard with Livepeer:

1. Pick "Destinations"
2. Click "Add a destination"
3. Pick "Custom RTMP"
4. Input `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live` in the "RTMP Server URL" text field.
5. Copy your stream key into the "Stream key" field
6. Input a name for the stream in "Nickname"
7. Click "Add RTMP server"
8. When you are ready to start your live stream, click "Create a broadcast" and
   pick the destination you just created, enter the studio, and click the "Go
   live" button.

To use Restream.io studio with Livepeer:

1. Click "Add channel"
2. Pick "Custom RTMP"
3. Input `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live` in the "RTMP URL" text field.
4. Copy your stream key into the "Stream key" field
5. Click "Enter Live Studio"
6. When you are ready to start your live stream, click the "Go Live" button.

## Step 3: Playback your live stream

Navigate to your stream detail page in the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and copy the
Playback URL. The playback URL is an M3U8 file, the basis for the HTTP Live
Streaming (HLS) format.

Livepeer.com doesn’t have it’s own player, but works with open source and 3rd
party players. For this tutorial, we will use
[Theo Player’s demo player](https://demo.theoplayer.com/test-your-stream-with-statistics).

Paste your playback URL in the text field at the top of Theo Player’s demo
player and click to load your stream. You may need to also press the Play button
in the player.

That’s it! Streaming with Livepeer.com is that simple. To get in touch, fill out
a [contact form](/contact).
