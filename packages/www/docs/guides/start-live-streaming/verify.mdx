# Verify a live stream is active

The easiest way to confirm a live stream is active is to login to the
Livepeer.com Dashboard, navigate to the Streams page,
[livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams), and
click on a stream name. Look at the Status row to see if the stream is Active or
Idle. If the status Idle, that means that Livepeer.com is not ingesting any
video with that stream’s `streamKey`.

## Verify stream status with the Livepeer.com API

Make a `GET` request to `https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}`, and note the
value of `isActive` in the response. `true` means the `stream` is active, and
Livepeer.com is ingesting video with that stream’s `streamKey`. `false` means
that Livepeer.com is not ingesting any video with that `streamKey`.

`lastSeen` represents when the stream was last observed by the monitoring
system. The time is reported in Unix epoch time. If the stream is running, the
epoch will be close to the current time.

Here is an example request:

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}"
```

This is an example response:

```bash
{
    "name":"test_stream",
    "profiles":[
        {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},
        {"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480}],
        {"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360}],
    "id":"ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
    "createdAt":1596081229373,
    "streamKey":"abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
    "playbackId":"efghb2mxupongp5k",
    "isActive":"true",
    "lastSeen":1596119750455",
    {other asset object keys}
}
```

## Return all active live streams

This example shows a decoded JSON object. But, remember that anything passed as
a parameter in a `GET` request URL must be URL encoded.

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": true}]"
```

## Return all idle live streams

This example shows a decoded JSON object. Remember that anything passed as a
parameter in a `GET` request URL must be URL encoded.

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": false}]"
```
