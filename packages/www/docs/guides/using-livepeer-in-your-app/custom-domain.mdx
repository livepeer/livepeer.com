# Use a custom domain for live streaming

The Livepeer.com global-optimized ingest URL is
`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}`.

You can CNAME `rtmp.livepeer.com` to customize that URL to something with your
brand, for example `rtmp.companyname.io`. You can configure this with your DNS
provider.
