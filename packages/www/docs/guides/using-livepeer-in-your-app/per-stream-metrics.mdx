# Per stream metrics

If you are operating a live-streaming or user generated content platform, you
will want to know the total duration of the "parent" stream object and the
duration of a "child" stream session.

## sourceSegmentsDuration

The value of sourceSegmentsDuration returned is the duration in seconds of the
asset source processed by Livepeer.com. On the parent stream object, this value
equates to the total amount of source video ingested by Livepeer.com all time.
On the session object, this value is the length of the live stream session (or
the session recording).

**`GET /stream/{id}` to retrieve a stream object**

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}"
```

**`GET /session/{id}` to retrieve a session object**

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/session/{id}"
```
